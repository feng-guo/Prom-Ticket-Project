Make sure to have the following in your main in this order
FloorPlan plan = new FloorPlan();      
plan.generateFloorPlan(tables);
while (true) {
	plan.displayFloorPlan();
}
Important:
The res folder is for the fonts and text files. Put them in the same folder that you place your src folder (so not inside the src).
The code should be fully functional now
If you are having problems with using the latest version of the compiler, do the following:
Eclipse:
Window (top)->Prefrences->Java(left)->Installed JREs->Click the jdk/jre->Select Edit on the right->Select Directory (beside JRE home).
IntelliJ:
Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S->Left panel, the platform settings->SDK->JDK home path(top mid-left)->change the file to the newer java compiler
